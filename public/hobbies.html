<h1>My Hobbies</h1>
<p>
 My hobbies are eating (especially cake) and sleeping. Usagi also enjoyed reading manga, shopping, and playing video games. In the live-action series, Usagi also loved karaoke, a favorite pastime of teenagers at the time. She had a tendency to force her interests on others, and especially tried to get Rei, a karaoke hater, to like karaoke. At the beginning of the Dream arc of the manga, Usagi said she wanted to join a manga drawing club.
